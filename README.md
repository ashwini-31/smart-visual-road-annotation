#  Smart Visual Road Annotation

A mini annotation pipeline to label Indian road scenes, analyze class distributions, and demonstrate how annotated data powers machine learning models.



##  Project Goal

This project simulates real-world AI internship responsibilities. It focuses on:
- Annotating images of Indian road scenes (vehicles, pedestrians, traffic signs, lane markings, etc.)
- Visualizing and analyzing class distributions from annotations
- (Optional) Demonstrating how quality annotations impact model performance



##  Learning Objectives

- Get hands-on with image annotation tools
- Learn COCO / Pascal VOC formats for object detection
- Understand how annotated datasets fuel machine learning
- Perform basic automation or quality checks using Python



##  Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Seaborn for visualization
- COCO / VOC annotation formats
